# Todolist made in PHP

Welcome to my todolist website. Click anywhere on the little Ã— to remove things or click on the text to edit things. You can do this with todos and categories. The number next to your todos indicates the time left until the due date. A red number next your todos means, that it's overdue and a green number means the opposite. Your data is stored online and encrypted, so you can see the same list on any device, but only on your account and the data is not readable in the admin database.
